# Video Play Speed Extension

[ðŸ‘‰ ä¸­æ–‡è¯´æ˜Ž ðŸ‘ˆ](./README-zh_CN.md)

> Powered by [adambullmer/vue-cli-plugin-browser-extension](https://github.com/adambullmer/vue-cli-plugin-browser-extension).

## Intention

Now we can only watch live videos of Miles Kwok (Guo Wengui) ðŸ˜Ž on Livestream which interestingly does not provide YouTube-like playback speed adjustment ðŸ™„. For me, a [996](https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU/blob/master/README.md) programmer, 2x playback speed is a must as I don't have much time ðŸ˜”.

## Features

* Up to 10x playback speed (useful to skim the ADs ðŸ˜‰).
* Support all the websites including Livestream and YouTube.
* Support adjustments of all the videos on the same page (seems useless).
